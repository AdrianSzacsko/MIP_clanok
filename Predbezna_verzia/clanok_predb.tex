\begin{abstract}
Nowadays technology surrounds us so much, that the way we study is highly impacted
by it. We are taking advantage of the web and many of us prefer to learn new things by
searching the Google rather than using books.

	In this paper we would like to sharpen the focus to the new ways of learning as well as
self-learning, compare today’s schools to the 20. century’s educational systems, ways we
implement the newest technological advancements to help us study and the future of
learning. In the last 10 years schools and colleges started to adapt and rely more on the use
of computers and the access to the internet. We would like to point out the differences, pros
and cons of digitalization along with the traditional methods of education. 

There are many benefits of using computers in the classrooms, like maximizing student’s engagement. Most
of the students are surrounded by technology and they enjoy using mobile devices, so the use
of technology is more likely to engage them in the learning process. However, this type of
study has negative phenomenon, because computers can be distracting for the students.
Chats, video games and the internet can easily take them off task. The pandemic we face
accelerated this digital revolution by requiring computers to work and study as well.

Dôležité súvislosti sú uvedené v častiach~\ref{dolezita} a~\ref{dolezitejsia}.
Záverečné poznámky prináša časť~\ref{zaver}.



\section{Nejaká časť} \label{nejaka}

\section{Comparison between traditional and digital teaching}

\subsection{Traditional teaching}

	The above mentioned teaching method is realized mainly in classrooms with "lecture". It refers to instructors delivering teaching matherials in the teaching activity, so called lessons, to learners to interpretation. It has been broadly used for the last couple of centuries and is still one of favorable teaching methods of instructors.\cite{Lin2017}

\subsection{Digital teaching}

	This type of teaching method can be realized through classrooms with lectures, however with digitalized materials and the use of the internet or modern technologies it has the flexibility to make the lesson distant. Digital learning become the most rapidly developed learning method in the past few years and can become the mainstream in the future.\cite{Lin2017}

\subsection{Use of teaching methods}

	There are various differences between teaching in traditional and digital form. These two ways of learning have their own positive and negative attributes, which highly contributes to the curiosity of the subject itself. Different material contents, learning channels, and practice methods are used between these teaching methods. Traditional teaching methods are superior for courses which require practical operations or teamwork, although learning contents focusing on convenience and flexibilty were more suitable for digital  learning. The digitalization can not replace completely traditional teaching yet, however the best teaching effect for learners are comprehensively practicing both methods in teaching activity.\cite{Lin2017}

\subsection{Strenghts of digital learning}

	Digital learning has many advantages for comparison with traditional learning. This method grants learners the freedom on time and space to select the best possible date for the online course and gives no pressure on the instructor when to make the teaching activity.  \cite{Lin2017}


\section{Online teaching during the pandemic}

	The pandemic situation accelerated the use of technology in many institutions, including secondary schools from all over the world. According to a study\cite{Babinkov2020}, in many secondary schools across Slovakia were different experiments conducted for the students to get to know the subject easier. These experiments played a tremendous role in chemistry and science education as stated in the study, however the lockdown negatively affected these type of observations. Schools needed to transfer the theoretical and the practical aspects of the lectures to online based activities. Based on the study itself\cite{Babinkov2020}, these experiments can be introduced in the following forms:
\begin{itemize}
\item Written descriptions assisted with photos
\item Video-recorded demonstrations
\item Live interactive demonstrations
\item Live demonstrations of experiments with data logging systems
\item Simple “linear” simulations
\item Virtual laboratories in the form of advanced multithread simulations
\item Remote laboratories in the form of remote-controlled real laboratory equipment
\end{itemize}

	The online experimental methods varied from school to school, however the experiments were still made despite of the lockdown. The study shows, that teachers shared and discussed the collected data with students, contemplated the pros and cons of different experiments. According to the teachers, they convinced that this approach made lessons more interesting/attractive to students, made problems easier to understand, and gave more time for discussion of results  compared with carrying out similar experiments during regular classes. On the other hand, they regret that students did notdevelop manual laboratory skills, that multiple data sets were not explored, and that they missed the direct contact with their students, which caused, i.a., a less effective discussion \cite{Babinkov2020}.

\section{The future of teaching}

\subsection{The technology itself}

	Today's technological advancements are growing rapidly, while more and more students get surrounded by the newest gadgets. Some of them are just temporary novelties, which does not evolve into fascinating products, however there are a couple of developments which try to change the world. One of them, which can be very useful and can revolutionize the future of teaching is the augmented reality. Augmented reality is a technology, which overlays the real world with virtual objects \cite{Tretyakova2019}.

\subsection{AR technologies in teaching}

	 In some fields, for instance in geometric building modeling AR has many advantages. The need naturally has arisen for teaching students new design methods at construction sites using AR technologies, i.e. creating not just a project of a building being constructed in the form of drawings, mock-ups, working documentation, but a model containing all the information about the object, which can be in demand throughout the entire period of its existence - from design, then to operation, and finally to demolition or reconstruction \cite{Tretyakova2019}. The use of AR in practice recently begun, however universities need to start to adapt this technology.

Môže sa zdať, že problém vlastne nejestvuje\cite{Coplien:MPD}, ale bolo dokázané, že to tak nie je~\cite{Czarnecki:Staged, Czarnecki:Progress}. Napriek tomu, aj dnes na webe narazíme na všelijaké pochybné názory\cite{PLP-Framework}. Dôležité veci možno \emph{zdôrazniť kurzívou}.
